## My Learning Path

### 1. Python (Starting Point)
I began my journey with **Python**, where I learned the basics of programming, logic building, and syntax understanding.  
This helped me understand how programming languages work and built my confidence to explore more.

### 2. C Language
After Python, I learned **C** to understand low-level programming concepts such as memory management, pointers, and structure of code.  
C gave me a solid foundation in logic and algorithmic thinking.

### 3. C++
Next, I moved to **C++**, which helped me understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and efficient problem-solving techniques.  
Now I am currently using C++ for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

## Current Focus: DSA with C++
At present, I am focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to strengthen my logic, problem-solving, and time–space complexity understanding.  
This phase is helping me prepare for future development and technical interviews.

## Future Goals
After mastering DSA, my roadmap is:

1. **Data Science** – Learn Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Visualization.  
2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI / ML)** – Dive deeper into neural networks and model training.  
3. **Cyber Security** – Learn ethical hacking, network security, and data protection concepts.

## My Vision
I aim to become a **multi-skilled tech expert**, mastering coding, data, and security.  
Step by step, I’m building a strong base to reach the top 1% in my field.
